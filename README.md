# Webinar-Tamagotchi

A simple project based on the C_School open webinar given by Piotr Wrona on August 25th 2020.

The project aim is to refactor, and develop the game from an elementary single-class sketch written on-the-fly 
by the lecturer, to a bit more sophisticated piece of code presenting more subtle mechanics at the business logic level.

The main idea - as mentioned above - was provided by Piotr Wrona.
The graphic design (probably) by Adam Milczarczyk.
